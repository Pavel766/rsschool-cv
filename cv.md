### About Me

I am a student at BSUIR. Before entering, it seemed that I would be taught programming at the university. But in reality it turned out quite differently. From the beginning of the third year, I began to study intensively on my own, and now I have a great desire to go further and further. At rs school I hope to upgrade my skills and gain experience in teamwork
